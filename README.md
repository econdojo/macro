This course takes an intermediate level approach to macroeconomic theory and its applications, building on the foundations developed in the principles of economics. It will provide analytical tools and formal models to explain the behavior of output, inflation, employment, interest rates, exchange rates, and other aggregate economic quantities. This set of tools is used to understand current economic issues, forecast the behavior of the economy, and assess the impact of policy choices. To optimize learning outcomes, this course incorporates artificial intelligence to enhance students' understanding of macroeconomic concepts. These AI tools provide personalized learning, real-time feedback, and practical application support. Finally, this course will help prepare students entering graduate education or starting careers in economics, finance, or policy-making.
